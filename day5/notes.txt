435. Non-overlapping Intervals

STEPS:
    1. sort meetings according to end times
    2. make count = 1 and assume you are attending for 1st meeting
    3. for every meeting from 2nd meeting to last meeting if it is starting after ending    the recently selected meeting, increment the count
    4. return total number of meeting - count



Job Sequencing Problem - GFG

STEPS:
    1. Sort the jobs according to pofit in decreasing order
    2. Take a slot array with length max deadline + 1 
    3.  For every job search for 1st empty solt from its deadline slot to slot 1, if found store its profit in that slot and BREAK, otherwise ignore
    4. Return number of non zeros and their sum of non-zeros in a list



Minimum Platforms - GFG

STEPS:
    1. Sort arrival and departure timings in ascending order
    2. Take i = 0 index for arrival, j = 0 index for departure, p = 0, m = 0
    3. While i < n and j < n: 
        a. if Ith train arrival time in less then or equal to Jth train departure time, increment 'p' and update 'm' and increment 'i' ELSE decrement 'p' and increment 'j'
    4. RETURN 'm'
